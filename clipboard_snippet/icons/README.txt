Icon Generation Instructions:

1. Open generate_icons.html in your browser
2. Click each canvas to download the icon
3. Save them as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png in the icons/ folder

OR

Use any image editor to create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG icons
with a clipboard/clipboard-like design.

The extension will work without icons, but they're recommended for a better experience.
